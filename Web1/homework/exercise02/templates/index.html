    <p>"Mary Oliver is saving my life," Paul Chowder, the title character of Nicholson Baker's novel "<a href="#">The Anthologist</a>," scrawls in the margins of Oliver's "<a href="#">New and selected poems, Volume One</a>." A struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case of writer's block. His girlfriend, with whom he's lived for eight years, has just left him, ostensibly because he has been unable to write the long-overdue introduction to a poetry anthology that he has been putting together. For solace and inspiration, he turns to poets who have been his touchstones -- Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke, Sara Teasdale -- before discovering Oliver. In her work, he finds consolation: "I immediately felt more sure of what I was doing." Of her poems, he says, "They're very simple. And yet each has something."</p>

      I don't know exactly what a prayer is. <br>
      I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down <br>
      into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass, <br>
      how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields, <br>
      which is what I have  been doing all day.
    </ul>
    <p>The cadences are almost Biblical. "Attention is the beginning of devotion," she urges elsewhere.</p>
