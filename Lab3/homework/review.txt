1. Why should we use functions at all?
-> Answer: 
	- Because their primary purpose is to help us organize programs into chunks that match how we think about the problem.
	- And with function we can reuse in other python files by import its files.

2. How to define/declare a function?
-> Answer:
	- The syntax for a function de?nition is: 
	def NAME( PARAMETERS ): 
		STATEMENTS

3. How to call/use a function?
-> Answer:
	- Function call:
		function_name( VALUE )
	- Example:
		#  Function definition
		def requiredArg (str,num):
			print('{0} {1}'.format(str, num))
		# Function call
		requiredArg ('Hello', 31)

4. What is return, why and how do we use it?
-> Answer:
	- What? return is:
		+ It returns the flow of control to the calling function. It also returns output/results to the calling function.
		+ Example:
		def am_i_wrong(answer):
    			if answer == 'yes':
        			return True
   		 	else:
      		 		 return False
	- Why? Because the return statement causes your function to exit and hand back a value to its caller.
	- How? return_stmt:    "return" [expression_list]

5. Do we have to use return in every function?
-> Answer:
	- No, it is not necessary. The function returns after the last line. There is no difference between a simple return and no return in some cases.

6. What are function arguments, why and how we use it?
-> Answer:
	Most functions require arguments: the arguments provide for generalization. For example, if we want to ?nd the absolute value of a number,we have to indicate what the number is. 
	Python has a built-in function for computing the absolute value, example:
	>>> abs(5) 5 >>> abs(-5) 5
	In this example, the arguments to the abs function are 5 and -5. 

7. How to use function from a different file other than our currently working file?
-> Answer:
	- We can do this in 2 ways. First is just to import the specific function you want from file.py. To do this use:
		from file import function. 
	- Another way is to import the entire file.
		import file as fl
	- Then we can call any function inside file.py using
		fl.function()
